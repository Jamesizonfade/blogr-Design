        <h4>Introducing an extensible editor</h4>
        <p>
        Blogr features an exceedingly intuitive interface which 
        lets you focus on one thing: creating content. 
        The editor supports management of multiple blogs and 
        allows easy manipulation of embeds such as images, 
        videos, and Markdown. Extensibility with plugins and
        themes provide easy ways to add functionality or 
        change the looks of a blog.
